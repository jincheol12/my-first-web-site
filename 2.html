<h2>PARENT</h2>

<p>A parent is a caregiver of the offspring in their own species.
In humans, a parent is the caretaker of a child (where "child" refers
to offspring, not necessarily age). A biological parent is a
person whose gamete resulted in a child, a male through the sperm,
and a female through the ovum. Biological parents are first-degree relatives
and have 50% genetic meet. A female can also become a parent through surrogacy.
Some parents may be adoptive parents, who nurture and raise an offspring,
but are not biologically related to the child. Orphans without adoptive parents
can be raised by their grandparents or other family members.</p>
